## Working
The RTS-993-9A is a CMOS LSI that plays its preprogrammed melodious piano song tunes when triggered. These songs are stored in its internal ROM and are played sequentially.

The oscillation frequency us used as a time base for tone and tempo generators, the accuracy of which affects the quality of the melody generator.

The circuit is configured in the One Shot mode,

A dynamic speaker is driven with an external NPN transistor.

The Typical Operating voltage is 3V.

You can find the IC Pinout and other details in the [Datasheet]().
